2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MKO/pwm_out_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) gen/counter_reg[0]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[10]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[11]/CLR,
gen/counter_reg[12]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[13]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[14]/CLR,
gen/counter_reg[15]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[16]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[17]/CLR,
gen/counter_reg[18]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[19]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[1]/CLR,
gen/counter_reg[20]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[21]/CLR, gen/counter_reg[22]/CLR
 (the first 15 of 34 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell deb_counter1/clean_reg_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MKO/clean_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell deb_counter1/clean_reg_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) MKO/clean_reg_C/CLR, MKO/clean_reg_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
